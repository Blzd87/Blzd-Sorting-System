# Blzd-Sorting-System
 Auto Sorting System

Instead of rewriting the setup of this sorting system here is a link to the WIKI page I've created to explain how to use this system
https://wiki.mcgods.net/blzd-item-sorting-system


Added almost all items from mob drops for sortfarm.mcfunction to allow a seperate sorting for mob farms.
Will be working on updating the Wiki to account for Chestroom Sorting & Farm Sorting Groups at a later stage when I get the time.
but for now you can see in the sortfarm.mcfunction which target frames that goto.
